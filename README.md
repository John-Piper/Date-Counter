# Date Counter Application

This React app was built as a challenge project inspired by the Udemy course [The Ultimate React Course 2023: React, Redux & More](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-react-course/learn/lecture/37350602?start=90#overview).

## About

The Date Counter app allows users to increment or decrement a step value and a count value, and displays the resulting date based on the number of steps from today. It also features a warning when steps is zero and a reset button to quickly set both values to 1.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the App

To run the app in development mode:

```bash
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## AI Assistance

AI (GitHub Copilot) was used to help build this project, providing code suggestions, component structure, and best practices throughout the development process.

## Purpose

This project is intended for my GitHub profile as a demonstration of my learning and progress in React, as well as my ability to leverage AI tools for efficient development.

You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
